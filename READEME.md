# A Christmas game

A game to play with the family; family Pedrosa (the version of family feud)


## What is the game ?

A host reads a question (e.g., "Things people leave in their car").

Each question has several popular answers with scores.

Two teams (A and B) compete. One team tries to guess the answers; each correct answer earns points.

If the team gets 3 strikes wrong, the other team can "cheat" by guessing an undisclosed answer. If they guess correctly, they win the points for the round; if they guess wrong, the original team gets the points.

Repeat for several rounds; the team with the most points wins.


### To visualize:
     ```python3 -m http.server```
